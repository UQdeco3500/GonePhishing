# How To Catch A Phish
***
Our prototype is a website based application. To run the application, download the code from our master repository. It is reccommended to launch it from the index.html file to begin on the login page (no login is required).
Note: the app is styled for phones, so it will show best using developer tools and setting the dimensions to a phone.
